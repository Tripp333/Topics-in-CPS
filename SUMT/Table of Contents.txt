In the code file, the functions are in the following order:


    function_eval(function, variables, point)

    initial_mover(constraint, variables, initial, epsilon, t_var)

    initialization(constraints, variables, epsilon)

    gradient_gen(variables, function)

    constraint_check(constraints, solution, variables)

    gradient_eval(variables, gradient, current, epsilon)

    stepping_function_gen(current, num_grad, function, variables)

    mover_function(variables, num_grad, current, stepping_function, constraints)

    gradient_search(variables, function, current, epsilon, constraints, r_value)

    constraint_gen(variables)

    p_function_gen(constraints, objective, r_value)

    distance_traveled(variables, current, next)

    SUMT(variables, epsilon, current, constraints, objective)

The program has three main parts:
    Initialization of intial solution
    The Gradient Method to find the optimal solution for that function
    The SUMT Algorithm which updates the function by changing the r_value

In python, you have to go to the bottom of the file to see where the program actually runs.
The program starts where the line "if __name__ == '__main__':" is.
